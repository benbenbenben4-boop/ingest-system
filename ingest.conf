# Ingest System Configuration File
# Place this file at /etc/ingest/ingest.conf to customize behavior

# Wipe mode options:
# 0 = Full wipe (dd zeros - SLOW but secure, can take hours)
# 1 = Skip wipe (no wipe at all - for testing)
# 2 = Fast erase (quick format - FAST, takes seconds)
SKIP_WIPE=2

# WIPE_MODE explanation:
# - Mode 0 (Full): Overwrites entire drive with zeros. VERY SLOW (hours for large drives) but most secure
# - Mode 1 (Skip): No wiping at all. Drive data intact. For testing only.
# - Mode 2 (Fast): Wipes partition table and creates new filesystem. FAST (seconds) and sufficient for most use cases.

# You can override this temporarily by running:
# SKIP_WIPE=2 sudo /usr/local/bin/ingest-drive.sh /dev/sda1
